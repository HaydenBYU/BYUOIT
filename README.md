Due to the fact that my Vue.js project had a README.md in it. My other README.md has been overwritten. Here it is again.

# Coding Assessment

## Backend
In order to start my backend server you must first download the folder labeled backend. Once that has been downloaded simply enter the folder on the terminal and run:
```
npm install
node server.js
```
You will get a line of text confirming that it has started and tell you which port it is on.

## Frontend
I struggled with using Vue.js but created a structure for it. So feel free to take a look at it in Next_Try.

After spending most of my time on Vue.js. I went to vanilla js and in about 30min got a minimalistic frontend working. If you run the index.html file then you will be able to access the movie api assuming that the backend is running. 
To run the file you can either double click it in your file explorer or run a live server on VS Code.

You should be able to search by one term and get a list of 10 movies in a json format. The correct information is provided although not as prettily as it could be.
