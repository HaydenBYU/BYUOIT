## Backend
In order to use the backend simply go to the backend folder and run the commands:
```
node server.js
```
You should see some text telling you that it is running on port 8080 on localhost.

## Frontend
I struggled with Vue.js so after two failed attempts I made a pureJS folder that did the same stuff in just HTML and JS. It will search one worded terms and return the results from the api through the backend if the backend is running.

If you wish to view my vue.js attempt simply go to my next_try folder and run:
```
npm run build
npm run start
```
Nothing will happen but that is how it should work. Feel free to see what the setup was. Perhaps I was somewhat close.
